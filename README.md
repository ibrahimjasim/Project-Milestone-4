## UX

###  Site Purpose:
The purpose of the "SooQ" website is to operate as an online marketplace for second-hand goods, allowing individuals to buy and sell items such as furniture, electronics, and personal vehicles. It provides a platform where sellers can list their items along with details and set prices, and where buyers can easily find and purchase these items at a reduced cost compared to new. The site is designed to facilitate user-to-user transactions with an emphasis on ease of use, accessibility, and efficient communication between parties. It aims to create a trusted community for second-hand transactions, making it simpler for people to find what they need or sell what they don't, all within a user-friendly and secure online environment.

### Site Goals:
* To provide a user-friendly platform for buying and selling second-hand items.

### Audience:

It is also designed for the everyday person who have unused items that can be sold using the platform.

### Communication:
The site uses a very simmplistic and familiar structure that allows the user to find what they want/need with ease. The bar at the header stays in place at all times allowing for the user to have access to the most popular shortcuts at all tiems. The items listed for sale have all the information a user mmight want to know before klicking on the item (imagge, short description and price).

### Current User Goals:
To buy, sell and explore the products listed for sale within the few available categories.

### Future User Goals:
To buy, sell and explore a wide range or categories, sub categories and niched products. 

### Future Site Goals:
- Being able to sign in/ sign up with Google, Facebook and phone number
- Adding categories for all possible items that can be legally and feasably sold on an online market platform.
- Adding sub categories that divides and separates the items for easy navigation, browsing and scrolling.
- Expanding the platform to other regions and in other languages.
- Adding a section where users can offer to buy items by providing a description/image and allowingg for other users who own the advertised product to offer it up for sale.
- Adding an alert-button when a certain item/keyword is listed so that the user can find the product they want immidietly after posting. 
- Allowing users to "highlight" ther products for sale by paying a small fee.
- Exploring the option of allowing advertising on the platformm to keep it free of charge at the basic level.

* Product images are large and prominent, making it easy for users to see what is being offered.
* The navigation bar at the top includes options for adding a new item, browsing, accessing the inbox, and viewing the dashboard, suggesting a user-centered design that facilitates easy access to the main features.

### Ease of Use:
