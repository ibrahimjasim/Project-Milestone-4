## The SOOQ landing page- not signed in

Has a panel at the top with clickable buttons. 
These consist of options to "Sign in", "Browse" and "New items". The  SOOQ-name is also cxlickable and will redirect the user to the landing page. 

The first items visible are the "Newest items". These are found within a light grey section in a grid pattern consisting of three items per row. 
In the future, the grid will be restricted to 3 X 3 rows in order to keep the page user friendly. 

Under the "Newest items" the section consisting of the three categories is visible. 
As of now there are three categories but options for adding and removing will be implimented for the admin of the page.

## How to use SOOQ as a new user

A new user can sign up to browse, list items for sale and contact other users to inquire about potential purchases.
The interface is very straightforward and simplistic in order to encourage the users to sign up and use the site.
As the new user arrives at the landing page, three options appear: signing up, signing in for existing users and browsing listed items without using/creating an account.
The new user will click "Sign up" and be redirected to a page asking for a valid username, and e-mail adress and fields for selecting and repeating password. 
After, the user clicks submit and will arrive to the browsing page.
In this fase, it is free to use the site but third party advertisments and fees could be implimented in the future.

## Testing

- I have manually tested the project by following these steps:
-  Clicked on the images, ads, buttons, links and categories.
-  Made sure that a new item can be listed, edited and removed.
-  Made sure that the admin-page tells me a new message has ben reveived by a "user".
-  Check if an item listed shows the correct price, description, category and images.
-  Newest items should be sent to the top of the "Dashboard" or landing page.
-  Related items should be suggested from the same/similar cetagories. (The Teddy has the Toy Car as a related item)
